# A Nice Pratt Parsing Demo

See http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/11/03.html

Requires Python 3.  Try:

    ./tests.py

Code should be typesafe:

    mypy . --strict

This code originally was originally based on the parser in [tinypy][], but
every line has been changed, except possibly for some tests.
